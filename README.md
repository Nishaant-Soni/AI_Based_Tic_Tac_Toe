# AI-Based Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

This project implements an AI-driven Tic Tac Toe game using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The AI employs various strategies, including Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Q-Learning, to provide a challenging opponent for the player. The application offers an interactive and user-friendly experience, allowing players to choose their symbols and compete against the computer.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** Built with Tkinter for an intuitive and responsive gaming experience.
- **AI Strategies:**
  - **Minimax Algorithm:** Ensures the AI makes optimal moves by exploring all possible game states.
  - **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Enhances the Minimax algorithm by eliminating branches that won't influence the final decision, improving efficiency.
  - **Q-Learning:** Implements a reinforcement learning approach for the AI to learn and improve over time.
- **Player Choice:** Allows players to select their preferred symbol (X or O) before starting the game.
- **Game Reset:** Automatically resets the game board after a win or a tie, enabling continuous play.
- **Winner Detection:** Accurately identifies and announces the winner or a tie at the end of each game.
